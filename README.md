Single Supply Synth Circuit Schematics
======================================
This repository contains a number of schematics for synthesizer circuits that
only use a single sided power supply.

* [Low Pass Gate / Voltage Controlled Amplified](./LPG_VCA/LPG_VCA.md)
* [4069 CMOS State Variable Filter / Wasp Filter](./WaspFilter4069/WaspFilter4069.md)

Let's define what those terms actually mean:

* **Synthesizer** : the circuits all have something to do with producing sound,
or modifying sound or modifying the circuit that is producing the sound.

  There are two different and distinct signal types produced and consumed by the
  circuits.  The first is **audio signals**, which are in the range of human
  hearing and the realm of human auditory perception.  These signals range in
  frequency between 20Hz and 20,000Hz.  Anything below 20Hz is perceived as
  rhythm, or clicking, and anything above 20,000Hz is ultrasonic.  Children,
  teenagers and people who haven't wrecked their hearing in loud music venues
  and constant headphone wearing (like me!) might be able to perceive frequencies
  above 20,000Hz

  The second signal type is **control voltage**.  These are signals that are not
  directly listened to but control (modulate) other circuits in some way.  One
  example is a low-frequency oscillator (LFO) that modulates a voltage controlled
  amplifier (VCA) which has an audio signal passing through it.  At low
  frequencies of the LFO, the raising and lowering of the volume of the audio
  signal will be perceived.  At higher frequencies of the LFO, a tremolo effect
  will be heard.

  Although I wrote above that the two types of signal are distinct, this is not
  entirely true.  An audio signal can be used to control another circuit, and a
  control signal can be listened to.  If the control signal approaches 30Hz, it
  will be perceived by most humans, as long as it is cyclic.  At the end of the
  day, voltages are voltages.  To excite a loudspeaker or headphone, the signal
  has to be cyclic (also known as AC coupled).  Many control voltages are not
  cyclic (also known as DC coupled), such as a pitch control voltage.  However,
  some are, like the aforementioned LFO.

* **Single supply** : many synthesizer circuits use a *dual power supply*
which has a positive and a negative power rail, as well as a ground rail.  For
example, the [Eurorack Standard](http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100m_e.htm) has
a Â±12V power supply.  There is a +12V power rail, a -12V power rail and a 0V
power rail.

  The circuits in this repository use only a *single power supply*, with a +12V
  rail and a 0V rail.  This makes it easy and cheap to build power supplies for
  these circuits, they consist of a 15V AC-DC converter (wall-wart), available
  commercially for little money, a linear power regulator, like a 7812, a diode
  (1N4001) and a capacitor.

  Many of the circuits create a virtual ground, by dividing the supply voltage
  in 2, using a resistor voltage divider, and buffering with an op-amp.  This
  creates a reference voltage, at 6V, that the signals generated by the
  synthesizer circuits can swing around.  Other reference voltages are also
  created, especially for the exponential converters where a voltage of about
  1V is created as the reference voltage.  This is produced by a resistor divider
  and op-amp buffer again.

* **Schematics** are standardised pictures of electronic circuit layouts, with
common symbols for the various components in the circuit, such as resistors,
capacitors, transistors, diodes, op-amps, digital logic, etc.  Schematics are
the *lingua franca* of electronic circuit design.

Finally, most of these circuits have been adapted from, inspired by, or just
plain stolen from circuits freely available on the World Wide Web.  For each
circuit I have acknowledged the inspiration, adaptation or theft where
appropriate and where I have remembered!

A lot of inspiration has come from the Electro-Music forum, specifically the
[Lunetta sub-forum](https://electro-music.com/forum/forum-160.html)

Other useful resources I have found on the web when designing single sided
synth circuits are:

* [Single-Supply Operation of Op-Amps](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/sboa059/sboa059.pdf)
* [Single-Supply Op-Amp Design Techniques](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa030a/sloa030a.pdf)
* [A Single-Supply Op-Amp Circuit Collection](https://mil.ufl.edu/4924/docs/TI_SingleSupply_OpAmp.pdf)

Each sub-directory contains a schematic, in PDF format, a breadboard layout and
an LT-Spice model that I generated when developing the circuits.
